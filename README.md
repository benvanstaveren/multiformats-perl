## Multiformats

A really, really bare-bones implementation of the Multiformat protocol as found on https://multiformats.io/ 

Consider this entire package experimental, things **will** break. 

## Github is not the primary repository

If you're reading this on Github, keep in mind that this package is not developed here; the only code that lives here is the main branch, put here to allow others to access it easier. Development takes place on my personal Gitlab instance, which should also explain the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file ;)
